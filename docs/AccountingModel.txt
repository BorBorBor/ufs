The accounting models
=====================

Groups
------

Groups are basically bars. It is used for grouping the bars own accounts
and the accounts of the bar's members.

In addition to its name and slug it has several fields:


Placeholder:

If the group is not used by a real-world group (because they are not using
µFS), but just is a placeholder for paying receiving transfers, the
placeholder field is set to True. This is used when creating transactions
related to other groups.


Limits:

``warn_limit`` and ``block_limit`` can be used to warn and block accounts
if their balance is below the given limit.


Admins:

This is a many-to-many field, containing the user names of all users with
admin access to the group and all of its accounts.


Typical accounts:

``bank_account`` and ``cash_account`` are pointers to two arbitrary
accounts held by the group which works as bank and cash accounts. These
are needed to receive transfers from other groups. Additional typical
accounts, like ``sales_account``, will probably be added in the future.


User Accounts
-------------

- User accounts have an *owner*, e.g. a real person.
- The *name* should be the name of the owner or another nickname to be
  shown, e.g. on the *krysselist*.
- Type is *Liability* for all user accounts. Liability is credit owed to the
  owner.
- *Active* is a flag indicating if the owner still is an active member of
  the group.
- The ``balance`` method gives the accounts balance at any time.


Group Accounts
--------------

Ownership:

Group accounts do not have an owner, but belongs to a group. Owner is
``NULL`` for all group accounts.


Typical accounts:

Most groups will at least have the two accounts *Bank* and *Cash*. Other
accounts may for example be *Income*, *Expense*, *Inventory* and *Result*.


Account types:

All accounts got an account type, examples follow:

- *Asset*: *Bank*, *Cash*, *Inventory*, *Hyttetur 2007* (debit to increase)
- *Liability*: *Supplier Debt*, person accounts (credit to increase)
- *Equity*: *Capital* (credit to increase), *Drawing* (debit to increase)
- *Income*: *Sales Income*, *Interest Revenues* (credit to increase)
- *Expense*: *Supplies Expense*, *Interest Expenses* (debit to increase)

See Wikipedia_ for more information on this.

Active account:

*Active* is a flag indicating if the account is still in use. E.g. if a
group changes it's real world bank account number, one would maybe create
a new account for it and deactivate the old one.


Transactions
------------

General restrictions:

- A transaction may only include accounts belonging to a single group.

  E.g., one can never create transactions with entries for accounts in
  different groups. However, one can create corresponding transactions in
  two groups at the same time.

- All transactions must have positive sums on both the debit and credit side.

- All users can register deposits and withdrawals, but the payed/received date
  will not be set before the group admin has approved the transaction and, if
  necessary, transfered the money in the real world.

  E.g. a user can request a withdrawal by registering it himself. Then the
  group admin will transfer the money in the real world bank system, and
  approve the µFS transaction (that is, set the status to 'payed').


Deposits:

If the credit entry is a person's account and the debit entry is the bank
account of the group the user account belongs to, it is a deposit from the
person to the person's account.

This gives that a negative amount on a liability account means that the
person has money to spend. A positive amount means that the person owes
the group money.


Withdrawals:

If the credit entry is a bar's bank account and the debit entry is a
person's account, it is a withdrawal from the person's account to the
person.

Typically a user registers a transactions of this kind when he wants to
withdraw money, then a group admin transfers the real-world money and
completes the transaction in µFS by setting the transaction's status to
'received' to signal that the debtor has received the money.


Transaction between user accounts:

All users can transfer money to all other users within the same group. The
group admin does not have to approve the transaction.


Registering sales:

When a person buys anything from his own group the corresponding sum will
be registered as a transaction debiting the person's account and crediting
the group's sale account.


Claiming expenses:

When a person has bought anything in the real-world for the bar, the
corresponding sum will be registered as a transaction crediting the
person's account and debiting the group's expenses account.


Settlements (aka 'BSF')
-----------------------

When people buy stuff at other bars, they build up debt between the bars.
This debt is settled in 'settlements' also known as 'BSF'.


Example:

The admin of group B creates an invoice for group A listing what each
person in group A owes group B. The admin of group A then registers the
amount to debit each user in group A and transfers the total to group B.
Transactions-wise this is done in two-by-two steps:

Upon creation of an invoice by group B,

1. in group B, a transaction with an income account, e.g. 'Sales' at the debit
   side, and an asset account, e.g. 'Owed by Group A' on the credit side.
2. in group A, a transaction with one or more user accounts of group A on the
   debit side, and a liability account, e.g. 'Debt to Group B' at the credit
   side.

Upon payment of an invoice by group A,

3. in group A, a transaction with an asset account, e.g. 'Bank' or 'Cash', at
   the credit side, and the liability account from step one on the debit side.
   When all debts are payed, all the non-user-liability accounts should have a
   balance of zero.
4. in group B, a transaction with an asset account, e.g. 'Sold to Group A', at
   the credit side, and an income account, e.g. 'Income', at the debit side.


Workflow optimization:

To optimize the workflow, the transaction in step two can be registered
(status: registered) when group B creates the transaction in step one, and
the transaction in step four can be registered (status: payed) when group
A creates the transaction in step three.

The group admin of the other group must in each case approve the
transaction in his own group, either when he accepts the invoice in step
two (if not, real-world communication is needed) or when he has received
payment of an invoice in step four (if not, real-world communication is
needed).


Workflow optimization pros:

The admin in step two does not have to enter all the people owing group B
money, while the admin in step four is alerted that group A has transfered
money in the real-world, and may then check if he has received them. This
reduces the need for pull-checking the real-world bank for new incoming
payments.
