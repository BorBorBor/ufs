TODO µFS v1
===========

Cross-group transfers:
- Add concept of received payment, to givs us two sided approval of transfer.
- Settlement (BSF-oppgjør)

Transfers:
- Make it possible for users to claim money from Expense accounts like
  'Innkjøp' when they have bought stuff for the bar.
- Make it possible for admins to delete unapproved transactions? Send mail
  warning to the end that registered the transaction?

Lists:
- Sub groups of users, active, pang...? Should list have a concept of who
  should be on it?

Sanity and robustness:
- Create unit tests for at least the model layer
- Use decorators to control commit/rollback of transactions

i18n:
- Translate itkufs/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
