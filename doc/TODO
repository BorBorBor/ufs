TODO ÂµFS v1
===========

MUST HAVE
---------

Model:
- Implement the new transaction semantics. See docs.
- set_reject, etc, need to be aware of placeholders and enfore who is allowed
  to alter state. Only needs to care about changes internally in a group. A
  user may reject his withdrawal request. An admin may reject everything not
  already recieved or rejected.
- Unit tests of account balance and lots of properties. See FIXMEs.
- Add group.sales_account or something. Must know what account to register
  sales and expenses on.

Views:
- Use decorators to control commit/rollback of transactions. What views?
- Cleanup reports.views.
- Finish group-transaction view, it doesn't know what to do with POST data yet.

Forms:
- More sanity checking, prevent admin from performing transactions that he does
  not have enough privileges to invoke (should be done in form and/or model)
  * get_valid_choices() must check session user before returning
  * Use get_valid_choices() in "Register transaction"
- Use newforms on lists.
- Finish rewrite of approve/change transaction state form.

Templates:
- Transaction list and approve transaction view et al. should resemble each
  other more.
- Generalize tabs somehow. Do not repeat code in all templates. Mark active tab
  dynamically.
- Update Norwegian translation.
- Add missing {% trans %} tags on tabs, etc.

New features:
- Admin rejection of user claims, using TransactionMessage, only missing
  emails, but perhaps messages is enough?

SHOULD HAVE
-----------

- Respect active flag for accounts, or at least indicate that account is
  inactive. I think the account summary does not allow showing disabled
  accounts, as of now.

New features:
- Settlement
- Invoice (printing and/or registering transactions at the other group)

MAY HAVE
--------

- User registration of expenses
- Create correction transactions in non-manual manner.

DONE
----

- JS code for toggeling checkbox'es in approve view
- Dynamic lists
- Admin mesage with feedback to approval
- enforce sum(width) < 100, implimented by relative 100%
- Move group info to account summary
- Refactor menu
- Income statement (see http://www.accountingcoach.com/)
- i18n: Add _() et al around all strings
- Add contact field to account group for first-line support
- Custom image for list
- List: IntegerField->PositiveSmallInt
- Enforce checking of admin rights, all we do today is hide menu...
- i18n: Translate itkufs/locale/no/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
- Split transation_list template into user/admin/menu
- Group
  * Rename AccountGroup to Group
  * Methods for registered_transaction_set, payed_transaction_set,
    received_transaction_set, not_payed_transaction_set,
    not_recieved_transaction_set in the Group model
- Transaction: strip down
- TransactionLog(transaction, type, timestamp, user, message) instead of
  transaction details and to know who did what to a transaction. Type is
  registered, payed, received and rejected.
- TransactionEntry(transaction, account, debit, credit) instead of debit/credit
  account and amount on Transaction
- Rename "list item" to "list column" or "list field"?
- Change NewTransaction to Transaction
- Modify Transaction so that we don't automagicly set it as registered, also
  ensure that entries can only be added to unregistered transactions, thus
  ensuring data integrity
- TransactionLog needs to enforce that user is set.
- Admin should be able to edit lists (adamcik)
- Account management, optionally connect with users
- Refactor of lists, statements, invoice etc to report app
- Lists: Who to include on the list?
- is_* for Transaction need to check against status not log
- http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/nov/02/handle-choices-right-way/
- Placeholder flag for group
- Convenience functions in Account model to match *transaction_set in group
- Update code with the new Transaction model
- Do not allow saving Transaction with accounts from different groups in debit
  or credit
- Updated transaction lists and detail views.
- Use new convenience functions for transaction_sets in Group model.

WONTFIX
-------

- Custom base.html for each accountgroups lists?
- Account list in admin menu
- Serial number to lists (somewhat in doubt...)
