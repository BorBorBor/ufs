The accounting views
====================


First time login
----------------

1. Authentication is done externally with Kerberos and HTTP Basic Auth.
2. If the µFS views see a REMOTE_USER which does not exist as a User object, it
   should be created, and the user redirected to a page saying:

	"A µFS user was just created for you. Please ask your bar administrator
	to create a bar account for you and connect the account with your
	user."


After login when account is assigned
------------------------------------

- If user is connected with multiple accounts, ask user to select an account.
  Goto URL: /itkufs/(?P<account_group_slug>\w+)/(?P<username>\w+)/
- If admin for the group, also point to the account group page.
  Goto URL: /itkufs/(?P<account_group_slug>\w+)/


Main account view
-----------------

- A menu with actions which can be performed by the user.
- If administrator and transactions are pending approval, say so.
