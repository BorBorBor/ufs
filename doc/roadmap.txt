Version 2: Inventory
--------------------

:Scheduled release date: July 2007

Version 2 ideas:

- Support inventory
  - When adding items to inventory, let administrator add purchasing price.
  - Suggest profit and selling price, but let the administrator decide himself.
  - Inventory counting with date, items, amount, and total value.
  - Let users register receipts and give the user a tracking number to put on
    the receipt.
  - Let administrators approve receipts registered by users and add receipts himself
    too.
- Other suggestions?

Please document the inventory application in doc/InventoryModel.txt and
doc/InventoryViews.txt before implementing them, and document needed changes to
the accounting application in the files mentioned under `Version 1:
Accounting`_.
