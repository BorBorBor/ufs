µFS Microfinance System
=======================

What is microfinance?
---------------------

From Wikipedia_:

    Microfinance is a term for the practice of providing financial
    services, such as microcredit, microsavings or microinsurance to poor
    people. By helping them to accumulate usably large sums of money, this
    expands their choices and reduces the risks they face. Suggested by
    the name, most transactions involve small amounts of money, frequently
    less than US$100.

What is µFS?
------------

µFS Microfinance System is a system providing financial services, such as
*krysselister* or transacations of small change, for the members of the
`IT committee`_ (ITK) of `Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem`_. The members of
ITK are students. Students are per some definition poor. Poor people get
new opportunities by microfinance, as shown by Nobel Prize winner Yunus.

µFS is thus providing services and opportunities!

Why µFS?
--------

The original intention with µFS, was to get in control of the bar economy
at our computer club. The rest of it was created because we could ;-)
